While it was an ideal store of value and could facilitate swift payments in a decentralised manner, the Bitcoin blockchain lacked a scripting language on which other applications could be built."

This could be achieved through smart contracts or encoded complicated functions, through which users could conduct safe and reliable transactions with each other."

Sharding and Casper, two solutions have been on the company roadmap, to make the network ready for increased transaction load. While Casper is a hybrid of the PoS and PoW protocols, Sharding is a concept that allows network nodes to store only a portion of the entire blockchain registry to validate transactions, in order to increase transaction speed and reduce energy consumption."
