Together with other indicators, they can signal whether a trend is likely to continue or reverse its path soon, enabling traders to make short-term decisions."

You could wait for a consolidation in the support region and buy when the price breaks through the high of that region. Similarly, you might wait for price consolidation near the resistance area, till the price drops below the low of the region to enter a short trade."
